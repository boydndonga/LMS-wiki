This is basically a collection of all the errors your are likely to face in your time at Moringa. 

We have divided it into two.

2. [Core](https://github.com/SamNgigi/LMS-wiki/wiki/2.-CORE)

**Note** however the ***D-triple-G*** rule. These are some key habits you should develop as a developer.

1. **D** for **Details** - Attention to detail will be of paramount importance. Almost 90% of all errors you will face will be simple syntax mistakes or spelling mistakes. So be very careful when you type and be very thorough in your work

2. **G** for **Git** - Make sure to commit regularly. Commit every key step you take in your app. This will make sure you don't have to start from scratch again and again when you get an error your unable to fix.

3. **G** for **Google** - Whenever you get an error, and you have thorougly gone through your work to make sure that it was not a simple spelling or syntax mistake, **Google it**. Because whoever you ask for help, that is most probably what they are going to do.

* When googling make sure to start with the specific technology first then the error or problem you want to figure out. For example;

 ```
 Git how to delete a remote
 ```
* or
 ```
 Angular6 How to add bootstrap 4
 ```
* Make sure to be as specific as possible and also you can modify search to get the result for the past year only.


4. **G** for **Grit** - This is the most important one of all. As a programmer your life will be 99% of the time fixing bugs. So you best be okay with that and don't give up. You'll figure it out.

**Note** that experienced programmers don't expect their code to work the first time. Infact the joy is the process of figuring out how, to eventually get it to work, while learning alot along the way.

Here are is a video highlighting some habits to avoid as a beginner. Feel free to jump to minute 1:30 for the meat of the video.
